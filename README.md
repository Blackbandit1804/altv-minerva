# altv-minerva
The #2 Open Source Roleplay Framework for alt:V. And the first one based on C#.

## What is it
Open Source Roleplay Resource based on C# for alt:V.

## Current status
Very, very, very early in the beginning. It is not ready to be used. I only recommend to use it as reference to see how some things are done.

## Whats about the future?
Well... I plan to work on it and implement more real features. But this can take long time.

## How to try it out
Please read the [wiki](https://github.com/ithr0n/altv-minerva/wiki).
